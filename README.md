# Music Shot

Generate shareable album images from Apple Music and Spotify links.

[Live Demo](https://sam-a1a.github.io/music-shot-svelte/)

> **Svelte Fork:** This is a SvelteKit port of the original Vue 3 project. You can find the original Vue version [here](https://github.com/ianho7/music-shot).

Music Shot is a SvelteKit application that parses an album URL, renders a phone-style album view, and exports the result as a high-resolution PNG.

## Overview

Music Shot is intended for quickly turning album links into reusable visual assets for sharing.

- Supports Apple Music and Spotify album links
- Extracts album title, artist, release date, cover art, genre, and track list
- Renders the result in a phone-style player layout
- Supports background blur, accent color, frame theme, title alignment, and export ratio adjustments
- Supports an optional signature with avatar and handle
- Exports PNG images locally in the browser
- Includes English and Chinese UI
- Provides separate desktop and mobile control panels

## Usage

1. Paste an Apple Music or Spotify album URL.
2. Fetch album metadata.
3. Adjust the presentation in the control panel.
4. Export the result as a PNG.

## Implementation Notes

### Album parsing

Music Shot normalizes data from Apple Music and Spotify into a single internal album model.

### Customization

Available adjustments include:

- background blur
- export ratio (`3:4` and `9:16`)
- dark or light frame theme
- title alignment
- accent color override
- signature visibility, avatar, and handle

### Export pipeline

The application captures the rendered phone frame in the browser, composites it onto a blurred cover background, and downloads the final image as a PNG.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- `@zumer/snapdom`

## Architecture

- Spotify data is parsed from the Spotify embed page payload.
- Apple Music data is parsed from JSON schema embedded in the album page.
- Browser requests are routed through a proxy because direct access to upstream pages is blocked by CORS.
- Export rendering is performed client-side.
- Locale, signature, avatar, blur, theme, and ratio preferences are persisted in `localStorage`.

## Requirements

- Node.js `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Format source files:

```bash
npm run format
```

```

## Limitations

- Only album links are supported.
- The parser depends on upstream page structures remaining stable.
- The current implementation uses `https://music-shot-proxy.0v0.one/` as a public proxy for HTML fetching.
- For production use, replacing the public proxy with your own backend or Cloudflare Worker is recommended.

## Possible Extensions

- Playlist support
- Single-track support
- Additional export presets
- Background style presets
- More resilient parser fallback logic
- Automated tests for parsing and export behavior
